# weatherpy

**Archived as Wunderground API is not longer available without having a weather station**

Python powered weather application
To be able to properly use this program, you will need to obtain an wunderground api key at http://www.wunderground.com/api and place it in a file called api.cfg in this folder.
This file should have only one line, and all that there is in the line is the api key.
